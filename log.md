# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 20: Sep 11, 2023
Today's Progress: Started Command-Line Rust

Thoughts: Life got busy, but back on this as 100 days before the end of the year is still possible. Decided to work through this book after looking for a resource that will leave me with the skills to start writing usable software. Command line applications are super useful in day to day VFX work, so it's a good place to work on as a Rust beginner.


### Day 19: Aug 14, 2023
Today's Progress: More Rustlings 78/95 exercises

Thoughts: Managed 3 exercises today and they were challenging. I'm not used to writing code in a functional style at all, and only wrote a couple of multithreaded python scripts so this is a little bit of uncharted territory.


### Day 18: Aug 13, 2023
Today's Progress: More Rustlings 76/95 exercises

Thoughts: Thinking in terms of iterators and stacking functions on top of each other without looking at the output is conceptually difficult for me. I'm used to printing out every result at at a time to verify what I'm doing. I should make more use of the debug trait(?)...


### Day 17: Aug 11, 2023
**Today's Progress**: More Rustlings 72/95 exercises

**Thoughts:** Lifetimes are something I've not seen thought of that way before. Still feel like I'm struggling with concepts that are basic to do in other languages. 


### Day 16: Aug 10, 2023
**Today's Progress**: More Rustlings 65/95 exercises

**Thoughts:** Quiz3 was good, managed to get through it faster than previously. Generics and Traits are really interesting concepts but the syntax is just such a hurdle so far. Especially coming from something as straightforward to write as python.


### Day 15: Aug 07, 2023
**Today's Progress**: More Rustlings 61/95 exercises

**Thoughts:** Life got in the way but back on it, good to know progress hasn't vanished from memory. Generics and traits are intersting concepts.


### Day 14: July 26, 2023
**Today's Progress**: More Rustlings 57/95 exercises

**Thoughts:** It's getting hard! Just finished up errors, rust feels like there's a **lot** of syntax learning.


### Day 13: July 25, 2023
**Today's Progress**: More Rustlings 51/95 exercises

**Thoughts:** Progress has slowed down a lot, the exercises are very syntax frustrating and I'm not sure I understand all the concepts covered well enough yet. But still progressing and finding it good to make sure I cram some time in to code as daily as possible.


### Day 12: July 22, 2023
**Today's Progress**: More Rustlings 48/95 exercises

**Thoughts:** Busy past few days but managed to squeeze in some exercises. Very happy to have got through quiz2, that was quite challenging.


### Day 11: July 18, 2023
**Today's Progress**: More Rustlings 45/95 exercises

**Thoughts:** Not as much progress as wanted but had to read a fair bit to understand the module system!


### Day 10: July 17, 2023
**Today's Progress**: More Rustlings 41/95 exercises

**Thoughts:** Didn't update yetserdays so rolled it all into today. Slower progress now as the problems are getting more difficult, strings are a bit different but I think string slicing makes sense now. 


### Day 9: July 14, 2023
**Today's Progress**: More Rustlings 32/95 exercises

**Thoughts:** Done with move semantics, ownership is a bit of a mind bend at times Moved onto structs next, decided I should also note the exercise numbers in the log to see progress through Rustlings. The AWSF has a working group for Rust, keeping an eye out for any simple work that could be done.


### Day 8: July 12, 2023
**Today's Progress**: More Rustlings

**Thoughts:** Move semantics, was a bit of a brain twister with ownership. I can see it taking a little time to sink in. The compiler sure likes to complain...


### Day 7: July 11, 2023
**Today's Progress**: More Rustlings

**Thoughts:** Really enjoying working through Rustlings, currently 22.1% through it. Finding a lot of the basic knowledge has stuck and getting to know the compiler through errors is clever!


### Day 6: July 10, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Start rustlings

**Thoughts:** The final part of the tutorial was ridiculously advanced, would like to go back to it at a later point but for now while thinking of a small starting project I'll work through some exercises on Rustlings.


### Day 5: July 09, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Rust closures and threads.

**Thoughts:** More tricky stuff, not had to do much of this before. Got there in the end, spent a while wondering why the challenge wasn't working when I just had to move a line of code outside the for loop! In Python I've only done multithreading a few times and it was always a little confusing...


### Day 4: July 07, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Rust enums and collections.

**Thoughts:** This was tricky, still haven't really got my head around it. I'll have to do some more reading/exercises to wrap my head aroud it.


### Day 3: July 06, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Rust structs and traits.

**Thoughts:** Managed to complete the exercise in good time. The next couple of videos were confusing (structs and traits??)  
   
  
### Day 2: July 05, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Rust ownership, referencing and borrowing.

**Thoughts:** Confusing and interesting at the same time. Rust syntax is still a little (very) alien to me.


### Day 1: July 04, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Primitive Types and Control Flow, working through a Udemy course unwatched for most of the year.

**Thoughts:** Working through the videos thinking about what to build as a project once I'm done with the course. Rust syntax is a bit confusing at first.


### Day 0: July 03, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Fork repo, set up environment.

**Thoughts:** Decided on starting the challenge, using it as a nice push to get into some dedicated rust learning.
