# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 3: July 06, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Rust structs and traits.

**Thoughts:** Managed to complete the exercise in good time. The next couple of videos were confusing (structs and traits??)  
   
  
### Day 2: July 05, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Rust ownership, referencing and borrowing.

**Thoughts:** Confusing and interesting at the same time. Rust syntax is still a little (very) alien to me.


### Day 1: July 04, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Primitive Types and Control Flow, working through a Udemy course unwatched for most of the year.

**Thoughts:** Working through the videos thinking about what to build as a project once I'm done with the course. Rust syntax is a bit confusing at first.


### Day 0: July 03, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Fork repo, set up environment.

**Thoughts:** Decided on starting the challenge, using it as a nice push to get into some dedicated rust learning.
