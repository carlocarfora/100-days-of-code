# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: July 09, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Rust closures and threads.

**Thoughts:** More tricky stuff, not had to do much of this before. Got there in the end, spent a while wondering why the challenge wasn't working when I just had to move a line of code outside the for loop! In Python I've only done multithreading a few times and it was always a little confusing...


### Day 4: July 07, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Rust enums and collections.

**Thoughts:** This was tricky, still haven't really got my head around it. I'll have to do some more reading/exercises to wrap my head aroud it.


### Day 3: July 06, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Rust structs and traits.

**Thoughts:** Managed to complete the exercise in good time. The next couple of videos were confusing (structs and traits??)  
   
  
### Day 2: July 05, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Rust ownership, referencing and borrowing.

**Thoughts:** Confusing and interesting at the same time. Rust syntax is still a little (very) alien to me.


### Day 1: July 04, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Primitive Types and Control Flow, working through a Udemy course unwatched for most of the year.

**Thoughts:** Working through the videos thinking about what to build as a project once I'm done with the course. Rust syntax is a bit confusing at first.


### Day 0: July 03, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Fork repo, set up environment.

**Thoughts:** Decided on starting the challenge, using it as a nice push to get into some dedicated rust learning.
